## Implementation Guidelines

To be listed here, an implementation must:

1. Follow RFC-0001 specification
2. Be publicly available (source or binary)
3. Include documentation
4. Not require proprietary dependencies

---

## Why List Your Implementation?

- Signal maturity to other adopters
- Share patterns and best practices
- Build ecosystem around a shared primitive

---

## Not Ready to List?

If your implementation is internal or experimental, you can still:

- Open an issue with "WIP Implementation: [name]"
- Submit a draft PR with "Draft: [name]"
- Wait until you're ready to commit to public maintenance

---

## Current Implementations

*None yet. This table is intentionally empty.*

The protocol is new. Being first here means defining what "good" looks like.

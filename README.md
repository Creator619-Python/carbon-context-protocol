# Carbon Context Protocol (CCP)

A minimal filesystem interface for propagating grid context to applications.
Exposes carbon intensity, data confidence, and time-of-use signals via `/run/carbon/*`.

Enables automatic scheduling of non-urgent compute during off-peak periods
to reduce cost, operational risk, and emissions.

- Specification: [RFC-0001-CCP.md](RFC-0001-CCP.md)
- Reference implementation: [reference/](reference/)
- Usage examples: [examples/](examples/)

Protocol only. No dependencies. No opinions.
